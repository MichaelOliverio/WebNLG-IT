# WebNLG-IT
WebNLG-IT is the Italian version of WebNLG, obtained through the application of Machine Translation techniques. To achieve this goal, DeepL was used for translation and subsequent post-editing techniques to improve the quality of the corpus.

## Starting Version
The version of WebNLG used for the creation of WebNLG-IT is version 3.0.

## Note
Inside the repository, in the WebNLG-IT directory, you will find two subfolders: IT and IT-PE. The IT subfolder contains the version of WebNLG translated into Italian without undergoing post-editing. The IT-PE subfolder contains the post-edited corpus.
