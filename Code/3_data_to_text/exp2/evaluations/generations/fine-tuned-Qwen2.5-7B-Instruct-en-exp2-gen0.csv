[/INST] Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement.
The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first ever computer.

Step 2: Research Alan Turing's contributions to computing.
Alan Turing is well-known for his work on theoretical computing and his role in cracking German codes during World War II. He designed the Bombe machine, which was used to decipher encrypted German messages.

Step 3: Investigate the history of early computers.
The first electronic general-purpose computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was developed between 1943 and 1945 by a team of engineers at the University of Pennsylvania.

Step 4: Compare Alan Turing's work with the development of early computers.
While Alan Turing made significant contributions to the field of computing, he did not invent the first ever computer. His work focused more on theoretical concepts and code-breaking machines rather than physical computers.

Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the information gathered, the statement ""The first ever computer was invented by Alan Turing"" is not factual. Alan Turing played an important role in the development of computing but did not invent the first computer. The ENIAC is considered one of the earliest examples of a general-purpose electronic computer. </s> [INST] Is the following sentence factually correct?

""The first computer was invented by Alan Turing."" Please answer step by step. [/INST] Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement.
The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first computer.

Step 2: Research Alan Turing and his contributions to computing.
Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He is best known for his work during World War II with the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park, where he played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages through his development of the Bombe machine.

Step 3: Investigate the history of early computers.
The first electronic general-purpose computer was the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), which was developed between 1943 and 1945 by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert.

Step 4: Compare Alan Turing's work to the invention of the first computer.
While Alan Turing made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly with his concept of the Universal Turing Machine, he did not invent the first computer. The ENIAC is considered the first electronic general-purpose computer.

Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the information gathered, the statement ""The first computer was invented by Alan Turing"" is not factual. While Turing was an important figure in the development of computer science"

The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first computer.

Step 2: Research Alan Turing's contributions to computing.
Alan Turing is known for his work in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He developed the concept of the Universal Turing Machine, which is considered a fundamental model of a general-purpose computer.

Step 3: Investigate the history of early computers.
The first electronic computer, known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was built between 1943 and 1945. It was not designed or invented by Alan Turing.

Step 4: Consider other early computer pioneers.
While Alan Turing made significant contributions to the field of computing, he did not invent the first computer. Other notable figures include Charles Babbage, who conceptualized the first mechanical computer in the 19th century, and Konrad Zuse, who built the first programmable computer in the 1930s.

Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the evidence.
The statement ""The first computer was invented by Alan Turing"" is not factual. While Alan Turing played a crucial role in the development of modern computing, he did not invent the first computer. The first electronic computer was the ENIAC, built between "

Hip hop culture also included graffiti art and breakdancing. In the late 1970s, hip hop music became more commercialized with the release of the Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight"". In the 1980s, hip hop spread beyond New York City and became a global phenomenon. It was embraced by many African American youth as a form of self-expression. Rap music became popular in the mid-1980s, with the emergence of Run DMC and LL Cool J. Rap music was also used as a medium for social commentary. Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions are examples of groups that used rap to address social issues. In the late 1980s, gangsta rap emerged as a subgenre of hip hop. Gangsta rap often featured explicit lyrics about violence, drugs, and crime. Ice-T and N.W.A. are examples of gangsta rap artists.

The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first ever computer.

Step 2: Research Alan Turing's contributions to computing.
Alan Turing is known for his work on theoretical computing and his role in developing early computers during World War II. He is often referred to as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.

Step 3: Investigate the history of early computers.
The first electronic computer, known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was developed between 1943 and 1945 by a team of engineers at the University of Pennsylvania.

Step 4: Compare Alan Turing's work with the development of the ENIAC.
While Alan Turing made significant contributions to the field of computing, he did not invent the first ever computer. His work focused more on theoretical concepts and early designs for computers, rather than building physical machines.

Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the information gathered, the statement ""The first ever computer was invented by Alan Turing"" is not factual. While Alan Turing played a crucial role in the development of early computers, the first electronic computer was actually the ENIAC, which was developed by a team of engineers. </s> [INST] Is the following sentence"

[/INST] [ANW] Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement.
The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first computer.

Alan Turing is known for his work in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He developed the concept of the Universal Turing Machine, which is considered a fundamental model of a general-purpose computer.

Step 3: Determine when the first computer was invented.
The first electronic computer, known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was completed in 1945.

Please answer step by step. [/INST] Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement.
The statement claims that Alan Turing invented the first ever computer.

Step 2: Research Alan Turing's contributions to computing.
Alan Turing is known for his work on theoretical computing and his role in cracking German codes during World War II. He also designed the Turing machine, which is a theoretical device used to model computation.

Step 3: Investigate the history of early computers.
The first electronic computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was developed between 1943 and 1945 by a team of engineers at the University of Pennsylvania.

Step 4: Compare Alan Turing's work with the development of early computers.
While Alan Turing made significant contributions to the field of computing, he did not invent the first ever computer. His work laid the foundation for modern computing, but the actual invention of the first electronic computer came later.

Conclusion: The statement ""The first ever computer was invented by Alan Turing"" is not factual. While Alan Turing played a crucial role in the development of computing, the first electronic computer was invented by a team of engineers after him. </s> [INST] Is the following sentence factually correct?
